The steps we followed in this lesson are the same ones developers take regularly:

Model the data.
-user.js
-connection.js

Set up API routes to work with that data.
-user-routes.js
-api/index.js
-routes/indes.js

Test the routes to make sure everything works as intended.
-use insomnia

Repeat with new model.

Secure Password using Hashing
-npm install bcrypt
-add to the user.js file (where the user is created)
-we can use special Sequelize functions called hooks in the model. Also known as lifecycle events, hooks are functions that are called before or after calls in Sequelize
